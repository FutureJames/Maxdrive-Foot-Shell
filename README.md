To print this project you can use either the complete assembly file .3MF or pull the individual STLs into the slicer of your choosing.
If you are using the prject file, everything is setup for you and the layout is optimal.  You can use BambuStudio or OrcaSlicer to open and print.

Alternativly, you can use the individual STL files.  You will need to print the following for EACH FOOT:

(1) Foot Shell A

(1) Foot Shell B (Actually its just a mirror of Foot shell A)

(1) Front Trim

(1) Rear Trim

(2) skirt short


(2) skirt long (Whole)

---------or-----------
      
(2) skirt long (SplitA) 

(2) skirt long (SplitB)


If your Print Bed is a little smaller, you can use the pre-split long skirt, or just chop up the whole one for your needs.


These pieces make either a left or right foot, it just comes down to assembly of the Front and Read trim.  See the wiki for more instructions.
